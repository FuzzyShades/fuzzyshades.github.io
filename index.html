  <h3>Welcome to my website! I'm the person who is going to save you money so everything in my G-fuel website is only $10!</h3>
  <h3>How I started: I started my remake of G-Fuel when I was 12 and ever since I wanted to give Youtubers what they wanted
  so I did...I started by buying my own supply of G-Fuel and sold in on a stand outside of my lawn. But when I was taking a 
  coding class they were teaching us how to make a website so I made my own website and sold it online I got probably double
  the profit and then became known for selling super cheap G-Fuel. Now that is my story what is yours?</h3>
